HIGH_SCORE table is for user-submitted high scores.

SCORE table is for every single score achieved (even if the user declined to
submit). In this table:

- "anon-sys-01" means "score was achieved before SCORE table was collecting
  names"
- "anon-sys-02" means "user did not have a previously-used name" -- SCORE
  table is logged before HIGH_SCORE table, so it only uses the
  "previously-used name" :(
